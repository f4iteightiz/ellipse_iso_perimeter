# ellipse_perimeter
Few programms in FOCAL (HP41) for 
a) ellipse perimeter calculation
b) ellipse isoperimeter curve representation
It request the MATH or Advantage modules (MATH for SOL or Advantage for SOLVE) for BPEREL and SCPEREL.
SCPEREL use printing functionality of HP-IL: it can be modified easily for having the points only being printed into the HP41 screen. However, the recommended setup is an HP41 connected to pyILPER on a PC via a PILBOX (in this case, the printing will be done on a window in the PC and the results can be easily transfered to complementary analysis at DESMOS.COM for example via a copy/paste of a PC editor).
