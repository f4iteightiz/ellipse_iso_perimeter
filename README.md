# ellipse_perimeter
Few programs in FOCAL (HP41) for 
a) ellipse perimeter calculation
b) ellipse isoperimeter curve representation
It request the MATH or Advantage modules (MATH for SOL or Advantage for SOLVE) for BPEREL and SCPEREL.
SCPEREL use printing functionality of HP-IL: it can be modified easily for having the points only being printed into the HP41 screen. However, the recommended setup is an HP41 connected to pyILPER on a PC via a PILBOX (in this case, the printing will be done on a window in the PC and the results can be easily transfered to complementary analysis at DESMOS.COM for example via a copy/paste of a PC editor).
Way for using the programms: read them and put them direct into the HP41 or
a) download the files in a PC
b) use the application hp41uc with "hp41uc.exe /t=SCPEREL.TXT /r /k". see https://sourceforge.net/projects/hp41uc/
c) upload the .raw file into the HP41 emulator V41 https://hp.giesselink.com/v41.htm
d) and use the programms there
e) ... or more ...
f) install pyILPER on your PC
g) transfer the programs from V41 into pyILPER
h) connect your HP41 with the PC via pilbox. Here you can order a pilbox http://www.jeffcalc.hp41.eu/hpil/index.html#pilbox
i) download the programs from pyILPER into your HP41; then use them
